# ADR-002: Latency Optimization for TradeBridge Trading System

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The TradeBridge trading system had critical latency issues that made it unsuitable for time-critical market navigation. The request chain was:

```
AI Agent → MCP Wrapper (stdio) → HTTP :8010 → HTTP :8020 → EA Bridge
```

Each tool call incurred:
1. **TCP handshake overhead** (~50ms) — new `httpx.Client` created per request
2. **Polling latency** (~500ms avg) — `_await_result()` polled every 0.5s
3. **Sequential round-trips** — `trading/decision_support` made 6+ sequential bridge calls = 3-5 seconds total
4. **No caching** — identical requests (e.g., `symbol_info`) hit the bridge every time

For a trading system, 3-5 seconds per decision cycle is unacceptable.

## Decision

### 1. Persistent HTTP Clients with Keep-Alive (All Layers)
- **Wrapper**: Replace `async with httpx.AsyncClient()` per call with singleton `httpx.AsyncClient` with `max_keepalive_connections=10`
- **MCP Server**: Replace `with httpx.Client()` per call with singleton `httpx.Client` with Keep-Alive
- **EA Bridge Adapter**: Replace `with httpx.Client()` per call with persistent client

**Impact**: Eliminates ~50ms TCP handshake per request. Connections are reused for 30s.

### 2. Polling Interval Reduction (0.5s → 0.1s)
- `EABridgeAdapter._await_result()`: `poll_s=0.5` → `poll_s=0.1`
- `mcp_server._await_result()`: `poll_s=0.5` → `poll_s=0.1`

**Impact**: Average wait to detect completed result drops from ~250ms to ~50ms (5x improvement).

### 3. Batched Command Endpoint (`_batch_enqueue_and_await`)
New helper that enqueues N commands to the bridge in a single HTTP POST batch, then polls all results together in one loop iteration.

**Impact**: `trading/decision_support` goes from 6 sequential round-trips (~3s) to 1 batched round-trip (~200-400ms).

### 4. Optimized Endpoints Using Batched Fetching
- `trading/decision_support`: 6 commands batched → regime + ATR + RSI + EMAs + coaching in ~400ms
- `trading/context`: 6 commands batched → full context in ~400ms
- `trading/coach`: 6 commands batched → full coaching in ~400ms
- `market/scan`: 3 commands per symbol batched → all symbols in parallel

### 5. TTL-Based Caching Service
New `src/mt5_mcp/services/cache.py` with domain-appropriate TTLs:
- `symbol_cache`: 30s (symbol specs change rarely)
- `account_cache`: 5s (changes with each trade)
- `price_cache`: 1.5s (order book changes constantly)
- `indicator_cache`: 2s (derived from bars)
- `bars_cache`: 2s (new bar arrives per timeframe interval)
- `regime_cache`: 5s (regime doesn't change every tick)

**Impact**: Repeated requests for the same data return instantly from cache instead of hitting the bridge.

### 6. EA-Side Batch Command Processing (MQL5)

**Option A: Faster Polling** — Added `CommandPollIntervalMs` input parameter (default 100ms). The EA now uses `Sleep(CommandPollIntervalMs)` between command polls instead of waiting for the next timer tick.

**Option B: Batch Command Pickup** — New `ProcessAllPendingCommands()` function replaces the old one-command-per-tick model. It:
1. Polls `/bridge/commands/next` in a loop
2. Processes ALL pending commands in a single timer tick
3. Uses `Sleep(100ms)` between polls for fast queue drain
4. Stops after 2 consecutive empty polls (queue is drained)
5. Caps at `MaxCommandsPerTick` (default 20) to prevent runaway

Also reduced default `HeartbeatSeconds` from 5 to 1 (MQL5 `EventSetTimer` minimum).

**Impact**: 6 queued commands that previously took 30s (6 ticks × 5s) now process in ~600-800ms (one timer tick + 6 commands × 100ms sleep).

## Consequences

### Easier
- Decision support calls are ~8-10x faster (3-5s → 200-400ms)
- Repeated data requests served from cache (near-zero latency)
- Market scan of N symbols is O(1) bridge round-trips instead of O(N)
- Cache stats provide observability into hit rates

### Harder
- Persistent HTTP clients require lifecycle management (close on shutdown)
- Cache invalidation must be triggered after trades to avoid stale data
- Batched parsing is more complex than individual tool calls
- Stale data risk if TTLs are too aggressive (mitigated by short TTLs)

### Trade-offs Accepted
1. **Slightly stale data** — 1.5-2s old prices are acceptable for AI decision-making (the EA polling model already introduces this latency)
2. **Memory overhead** — Caching uses ~1-2MB for typical usage (acceptable)
3. **Complexity** — Batched parsing adds ~100 lines per endpoint (justified by 8-10x speedup)

### Not Done (Future)
- **WebSocket push** — Would eliminate polling entirely but requires MQL5 EA rewrite
- **Request deduplication** — Concurrent identical requests could share a single bridge call
- **Direct socket from wrapper to EA** — Would bypass HTTP proxy chain entirely

## Files Changed
- `src/mt5_mcp/services/cache.py` — New TTL caching service
- `src/mt5_mcp/adapters/ea_bridge_adapter/adapter.py` — Persistent HTTP client, 0.1s polling
- `apps/mcp_server/main.py` — Persistent HTTP client, batched endpoints, 0.1s polling
- `tools/mcp_mt5_wrapper.py` — Persistent async HTTP clients
- `tests/test_cache_service.py` — 21 new tests for cache service
