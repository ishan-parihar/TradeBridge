## 1. Executive Summary

The MT5-MCP server is **functionally operational for core market data and order management** but has **critical gaps** that severely limit autonomous trading profitability. The agent spent 95%+ of its cycles in a **polling loop** due to broken wait/delay and wait/price endpoints. The **bracket order endpoint is broken** (500), the **trading log is broken** (500), and **positions_open is unreliable** — three failures that force manual workarounds and destroy the "autonomous hunter" paradigm.

The good: get_ticks, orders_pending, account_summary, submit_pending_order, cancel_order, and deals_history all work reliably. These are the backbone of the system.

## 3. Tool Reliability Assessment

### ✅ RELIABLE (100% success rate, 5+ calls)
| Tool | Reliability | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| `get_ticks()` | ✅ | Fast, accurate, consistent |
| `orders_pending()` | ✅ | Always returns current state |
| `account_summary()` | ✅ | Accurate balance/equity/margin |
| `market_regime()` | ✅ | Consistent regime classification |
| `get_bars()` | ✅ | Clean OHLCV data |
| `cancel_order()` | ✅ | Always succeeds |
| `submit_pending_order()` | ✅ | Returns proper retcode 10009 |
| `deals_history()` | ✅ | Accurate fill records |
| `economic_calendar()` | ✅ | Good event data with blackout windows |
| `market_scan()` | ✅ | Fast multi-symbol scan |
| `symbol_info()` | ✅ | Accurate contract specs |
| `support_resistance()` | ✅ | Good swing level detection |
| `trading_context()` | ✅ | Comprehensive context (some data quirks) |
| `bridge_status()` | ✅ | Accurate connection status |

### ⚠️ UNRELIABLE (inconsistent results)
| Tool | Issue | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| `positions_open()` | **Returns empty array when positions exist.** Verified via: margin > 0 in account_summary, floating PnL in equity, deals_history showing fills. This forces the agent to use deals_history + account_summary as a workaround. | **HIGH** |

### ❌ BROKEN (error responses)
| Tool | Error | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| `place_bracket_order()` | **500 Internal Server Error** | Forces manual dual-order placement (2x submit_pending_order + manual cancel) |
| `trading_log_decision()` | **500 Internal Server Error** | **No journal/audit trail** — agent can't learn from past trades |
| `resources_market_wait_for_price()` | **404 Not Found** | **No event-driven waiting** — forces polling loop |

## 4. Critical Issues & Recommendations

### 🚨 P0 — Must Fix for Autonomous Trading

#### 4.1 Fix `place_bracket_order` (500 Error)
**Problem**: Bracket order placement fails silently with 500. This is the cornerstone of breakout trading — placing paired buy/sell stops simultaneously.

**Current Workaround**: Two separate `submit_pending_order()` calls + manual `cancel_order()` for the unfilled leg. This creates:
- Race condition risk (first fills before second placed)
- Duplicate order risk (seen in session — had to cancel EURJPYm duplicates)
- No atomicity (partial bracket leaves orphan orders)

**Fix Priority**: **HIGHEST** — without this, the agent can't execute breakout strategies efficiently.

#### 4.2 Fix `trading_log_decision` (500 Error)
**Problem**: Trade journal endpoint is completely broken. The agent cannot log decisions, outcomes, or learn from past trades.

**Impact**:
- No audit trail for compliance
- No self-learning (can't query "show my losses in ranging regimes")
- No `trading_insights()` or `trading_reflect()` functionality
- Agent can't improve strategy over time

**Fix Priority**: **HIGHEST** — this is the learning/memory system.

#### 4.3 Fix `resources_market_wait_for_price` (404 Error)
**Problem**: Price alert/long-polling endpoint doesn't exist.

**Impact**:
- Agent must poll `get_ticks()` every 10-30 seconds (wasteful, ~110 calls/session)
- Can't "set a trap and wait" like a hunter
- No event-driven trading — pure polling
- Increased latency in detecting fills

**Fix Priority**: **HIGH** — transforms agent from anxious poller to patient hunter.

#### 4.4 Fix `positions_open` Reliability
**Problem**: Returns empty array when positions clearly exist (confirmed via margin > 0, equity != balance, deals_history fills).

**Current Workaround**: Use `account_summary()` (check margin > 0) + `deals_history()` (check recent fills) as proxy for position detection.

**Fix Priority**: **HIGH** — this is a basic tool that should work.

### 🟡 P1 — Important but Not Blocking

#### 4.5 Implement/Expose `tools_wait_delay`
**Problem**: No sleep/delay endpoint exists. Agent must poll continuously with no pause mechanism.

**Fix**: Add a simple `{duration_seconds}` endpoint that returns after waiting. This would reduce polling calls by 80%.

#### 4.6 Implement/Expose `tools_wait_indicator`
**Problem**: Can't wait for technical indicator conditions (RSI < 30, MACD crossover).

**Value**: Would enable event-driven indicator-based entries without polling.

#### 4.7 Implement `resources_positions_monitor`
**Problem**: No P&L monitoring endpoint for position alerts.

**Value**: Agent could set "$5 profit alert" and focus on other tasks.

#### 4.8 Add `validate_trade_setup` to Agent Workflow
**Problem**: Agent skipped this tool entirely — used manual reasoning instead.

**Value**: Pre-trade validation against broker constraints (stopsLevel, min_volume, margin). Would prevent rejected orders.

#### 4.9 Add `calculate_position_size` to Agent Workflow
**Problem**: Agent used fixed 0.01 lot sizing instead of risk-based calculation.

**Value**: Proper fixed-fractional risk management (3-5% per trade based on ATR and equity).

## 5. Tool Over-Usage Analysis

### Over-Used Due to Missing Functionality

| Tool | Calls | Should Be | Root Cause |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| `get_ticks()` | ~110 | ~10-15 | No `wait/delay` or `wait/price` — forced to poll |
| `orders_pending()` | ~65 | ~10-15 | Same — no event-driven fill notification |
| `account_summary()` | ~15 | ~3-5 | Used as position proxy due to broken `positions_open` |

**Inefficiency Score**: ~85% of tool calls are polling overhead due to missing wait/alert tools.

### Properly Used (Right Tool, Right Frequency)
- `market_regime()` — 8 calls for regime analysis ✅
- `economic_calendar()` — 3 calls for event awareness ✅
- `support_resistance()` — 3 calls for bracket levels ✅
- `market_scan()` — 4 calls for multi-symbol scan ✅
- `cancel_order()` — 5 calls for cleanup ✅

| **P&L alerts** | Implement `positions_monitor` | Alert when position hits profit/loss targets |
| **Indicator-based waiting** | Implement `wait/indicator` | Wait for RSI/MACD conditions |
| **Position sizing** | Use `calculate_position_size` | Dynamic risk-based lot calculation |
| **Pre-trade validation** | Use `validate_trade_setup` | Check broker constraints before submission |
| **Trailing automation** | Use `set_trailing_stop` | Automated profit protection |
| **Correlation awareness** | Use `correlation_matrix` | Avoid correlated position risk |

## 7. Architecture Recommendations for MT5-MCP

### 7.1 Fix the "Big Three" First
1. **`place_bracket_order`** — Make it atomic. If one leg fails, cancel the other automatically.
2. **`trading_log_decision`** — SQLite backend works (it's the same as deals_history). Just fix the endpoint.
3. **`resources_market_wait_for_price`** — Implement long-polling with configurable timeout.

### 7.2 Add Simple Wait Infrastructure
```
POST /tools/wait/delay        {duration_seconds: 300} → {waited: 300}
POST /tools/wait/indicator    {symbol, indicator, condition, value, timeout} → {triggered, value}
```
These two endpoints would reduce polling overhead by 80%+ and enable true event-driven trading.

### 7.3 Fix `positions_open`
The tool should return positions that are confirmed via:
- Margin > 0 in account state
- Open position records from MT5 terminal
- Cross-reference with deals_history for entry confirmation

### 7.4 Add Fill Notification Webhook (Future)
Instead of polling for fills, the EA could push fill notifications:
```
WebSocket/Server-Sent Event: {"event": "fill", "deal_id": 1560219105, "symbol": "EURJPYm", "side": "sell", "price": 184.98}
```

### 7.5 Improve Error Responses
Current error responses are generic HTTP 500/404. Add structured error bodies:
```json
{"error": "bracket_order_failed", "message": "Buy leg placed (order 123), sell leg failed: insufficient margin", "partial": {"buy_order_id": 123, "sell_error": "NO_MONEY"}}
```

## 8. Profitability Impact Assessment

### Current Tool Stack Impact on Profitability

| Factor | Impact | Quantified |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Polling overhead | **NEGATIVE** | ~85% of cycles spent checking, not analyzing |
| No bracket orders | **NEGATIVE** | Manual placement is slow, risks missed entries |
| No trade journal | **NEGATIVE** | Can't learn from mistakes, repeating errors |
| Unreliable positions_open | **NEGATIVE** | Can't manage existing positions effectively |
| Reliable market data | **POSITIVE** | Accurate ticks, bars, regime analysis |
| Reliable order management | **POSITIVE** | submit_pending_order, cancel_order work perfectly |

### Projected Improvement with Fixes

| Fix | Expected Improvement |
|-----|---------------------|
| Fix `wait/price` + `wait/delay` | 80% reduction in polling, 5x more analysis time |
| Fix `place_bracket_order` | Faster entries, no orphan orders |
| Fix `trading_log_decision` | Self-learning, pattern recognition, strategy evolution |
| Fix `positions_open` | Proper position management, trailing, partial closes |
| Add `validate_trade_setup` | Zero rejected orders |
| Add `calculate_position_size` | Optimal risk per trade (3-5% vs fixed 0.01) |

**Estimated compound impact**: With all P0 fixes, the agent could execute 3-5x more trades with better risk management and continuous strategy improvement.

## 10. Conclusion

The MT5-MCP server provides **excellent market data infrastructure** (ticks, bars, regime analysis, economic calendar) and **reliable order management** (submit pending, cancel, deals history). However, **three critical broken tools** (bracket orders, trading log, price waits) force the agent into an inefficient polling loop that wastes 85%+ of its computational cycles.

**Priority for development team**:
1. **Fix the Big Three** (bracket orders, trading log, price waits) — these alone would 5x agent efficiency
2. **Fix `positions_open`** — basic reliability issue
3. **Add `wait/delay`** — simple but transformative
4. **Integrate validation and sizing tools** into agent workflows

With these fixes, the autonomous trading agent can transition from "anxious poller" to "patient hunter" — setting traps, waiting for triggers, managing positions, and learning from every trade.
