# MetaTrader 5 ↔ MCP Bridge Blueprint for Arch Linux

Version: 1.0  
Audience: R&D engineering, platform engineering, quant engineering, infra/security  
Status: Deployment-ready architecture blueprint

***

## 1) Executive intent

This blueprint defines a production-oriented bridge that connects a locally running MetaTrader 5 environment to an MCP server so an AI agent can:

- observe market state,
- inspect account/positions/orders,
- request analytics,
- propose trade actions,
- execute approved trades on a live or paper account.

The design assumes the operator workstation or VPS is **Arch Linux**. Because MetaTrader 5 Python integration is designed around direct IPC with a MetaTrader 5 terminal, the MT5 execution side must be isolated into a dedicated bridge runtime colocated with a compatible MT5 terminal process, while the MCP layer remains the standard interface exposed to the AI host.

***

## 2) Design principles

1. **MCP-first interface**: expose resources for context, tools for actions, prompts for guided workflows.
2. **Read path and write path separated**: market/account reads are isolated from trade execution.
3. **Policy gate before execution**: no direct model-to-broker access.
4. **Idempotent execution**: every execution request has a deterministic client order ID.
5. **Human-governable**: supports approval modes from manual to autonomous.
6. **Linux-native control plane**: orchestration, logs, secrets, monitoring run on Arch Linux.
7. **Terminal-adjacent execution plane**: MT5 interaction runs in the environment that can reliably talk to the MT5 terminal.
8. **Auditability**: every quote snapshot, plan, tool call, approval, and execution result is traceable.

***

## 3) Target architecture

```

### Logical planes

- **AI plane**: AI host + MCP client.
- **Control plane**: MCP server, policy engine, prompt/router layer, observability, auth.
- **Data plane**: market cache, historical data, derived features, order/position state.
- **Execution plane**: MT5 execution worker and terminal session.

***

## 4) Arch Linux deployment stance

### Recommended stance

Use **Arch Linux as the primary orchestration host** and run the MT5 execution side as one of these deployment modes:

#### Mode A — Recommended for reliability
- Arch Linux host runs MCP server, database, policy engine, telemetry, dashboards.
- A dedicated **Windows VM or Windows VPS** runs MT5 terminal + Python execution worker.
- Linux and Windows communicate over a private authenticated API/event bus.

#### Mode B — Possible, more experimental
- Arch Linux host runs MT5 terminal under Wine / Bottles / Lutris.
- A colocated execution worker attempts MetaTrader 5 Python IPC against that terminal.
- This mode is for R&D only until validated under prolonged soak tests.

#### Mode C — Hybrid local workstation
- Arch Linux workstation runs MCP stack.
- Small Windows mini-PC or VM runs MT5 bridge.
- Best for local discretionary + agent-assisted trading.

### Engineering decision

For a deployable blueprint, the bridge is designed so the **execution adapter is replaceable**. The rest of the system stays unchanged whether MT5 is reached via:

- Python MetaTrader5 package attached to a local terminal,
- a custom EA socket bridge,
- a REST shim exposed by a terminal-side worker,
- a FIX/broker-native adapter in the future.

***

## 5) Recommended bridge pattern

### Primary recommendation: Dual-adapter bridge

Implement two compatible execution adapters behind a shared `ExecutionPort` interface:

#### Adapter 1: `PyMT5Adapter`
- Uses Python `MetaTrader5` package.
- Fastest path for account info, bars, positions, orders, and `order_send` workflows.
- Preferred when terminal-side IPC is stable.

#### Adapter 2: `EASocketAdapter`
- Custom MQL5 Expert Advisor inside MT5.
- Communicates with Linux MCP stack over WebSocket/gRPC/ZeroMQ/HTTP.
- Provides a fallback when Python terminal IPC is unreliable on Linux/Wine.
- Can also stream richer terminal-side events in real time.

### Why dual-adapter

It de-risks the project:
- R&D can start quickly with Python integration.
- Production hardening can migrate critical execution to the EA path.
- MCP contracts do not change.

***

## 6) System components

***

## 7) MCP contract design

### 7.1 Resources

Resources are read-only contextual objects exposed to the AI.

#### Core resources

- `mt5://terminal/status`
- `account://summary`
- `account://limits`
- `positions://open`
- `orders://pending`
- `history://deals?from=...&to=...`

- `risk://exposure`
- `risk://drawdown`
- `analytics://signal/{strategy}/{symbol}`
- `analytics://regime/{symbol}`
- `execution://recent`

#### Resource response schema principles

Each resource should include:
- `as_of`
- `source`

- `staleness_ms`
- `data`
- `warnings`

### 7.2 Tools

- `risk_check_before_execution`
- `position_management_review`
- `market_regime_brief`
- `session_open_brief`
- `incident_triage_terminal_disconnected`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AI as AI Host
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant MD as Market Data Service
    participant EX as Execution Worker
    participant MT5 as MT5 Terminal

    AI->>MCP: read bars://XAUUSD/M15?count=500
    MCP->>MD: get normalized bars
    MD->>EX: fetch bars
    EX->>MT5: copy_rates_from_pos
    MT5-->>EX: bars
    EX-->>MD: raw bars
    MD-->>MCP: normalized snapshot
    MCP-->>AI: resource content
```

### 9.2 Trade execution flow

```mermaid

    participant AI as AI Host
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant POL as Policy Engine
    participant GW as Execution Gateway
    participant EX as Execution Worker
    participant MT5 as MT5 Terminal
    participant BR as Broker

- `recommend_only`
- `human_approval_required`
- `bounded_auto`
- `full_auto` (not recommended initially)

For `human_approval_required`, no terminal call is made until a signed approval token is attached to the intent.

***

## 10) Linux-to-MT5 bridging strategy

### Problem

On Arch Linux, MetaTrader 5 terminal support and Python IPC reliability may vary depending on Wine/runtime conditions. The architecture must therefore avoid binding the entire system to one fragile path.

### Solution

#### Bridge Gateway API
Create a small authenticated gateway between the MCP server and execution workers.

Interface examples:
- `POST /bridge/health`
- `POST /bridge/account/summary`
- `POST /bridge/market/bars`
- `POST /bridge/orders/submit`
- `POST /bridge/orders/modify`
- `POST /bridge/positions/close`

This gateway can be reached by:
- local worker on the same host,
- worker in a Windows VM,
- worker behind Tailscale/WireGuard on a remote VPS.

### Worker selection algorithm

1. Prefer healthy primary worker.
2. If primary unhealthy, fail over to standby worker.
3. If write-path unhealthy, keep read-only resources available.
4. If adapter mismatch occurs, deny writes and raise incident.

## 12) Service interfaces

### 12.1 `ExecutionPort`

```python
class ExecutionPort(Protocol):
    def health(self) -> HealthStatus: ...
    def terminal_status(self) -> TerminalStatus: ...
    def account_summary(self) -> AccountSummary: ...
    def get_positions(self, filters: PositionFilters) -> list[Position]: ...
    def get_orders(self, filters: OrderFilters) -> list[Order]: ...
    def get_bars(self, symbol: str, timeframe: str, count: int) -> Bars: ...
    def estimate_margin(self, req: MarginEstimateRequest) -> MarginEstimate: ...
    def simulate_order(self, req: TradeIntent) -> SimulationResult: ...
    def submit_order(self, req: TradeIntent) -> ExecutionResult: ...
    def modify_order(self, req: ModifyOrderRequest) -> ExecutionResult: ...
    def close_position(self, req: ClosePositionRequest) -> ExecutionResult: ...
```

### 12.2 Adapter contract requirements

All adapters must:
- return canonical models only,
- preserve raw broker/terminal payload under `raw`,
- map errors to a shared enum,
- implement heartbeat,
- support dry-run for simulation where possible.

***

## 13) Security model

### 13.1 Trust boundaries

- Boundary A: AI host ↔ MCP server
- Boundary B: MCP server ↔ execution gateway
- Boundary C: execution worker ↔ MT5 terminal
- Boundary D: MT5 terminal ↔ broker

### 13.2 Controls

- Mutual TLS or WireGuard/Tailscale between services
- Signed JWT service identity
- Separate credentials per environment
- Secret storage via `sops` + age, Vault, or 1Password Connect
- Per-tool authorization policy
- Human confirmation for sensitive tools
- Immutable audit log for execution actions

### 13.3 Tool risk classes

- **Class 0**: read-only market/account tools
- **Class 1**: analysis/simulation tools
- **Class 2**: order creation/modification/cancellation
- **Class 3**: admin tools and mode switching

Class 2 and 3 must require explicit policy and may require human approval.

***

## 14) Reliability model

### Health states
- `healthy`
- `degraded_read_only`
- `degraded_write_blocked`
- `disconnected`
- `incident`

### Failure handling

#### Terminal disconnected
- Block writes immediately.
- Mark market resources stale.
- Alert operator.
- Auto-reconnect with bounded retries.

#### Broker rejects order
- Preserve rejection reason.
- Do not retry non-idempotent broker rejects blindly.
- Expose rejection via MCP result.

#### Duplicate tool call
- Use `idempotency_key` to avoid duplicate order submission.

#### Stale prices
- Rebuild quote snapshot and rerun policy checks before send.

#### EA/Python adapter mismatch
- Enter `degraded_write_blocked`.

***

## 15) Data model and schema store

### Core tables

- `accounts`
- `terminal_sessions`
- `symbols`
- `bar_snapshots`
- `ticks`
- `positions`
- `orders`
- `deals`
- `execution_intents`
- `execution_events`
- `tool_audit`
- `policy_decisions`
- `approval_events`
- `adapter_health`

### Retention

- ticks: 7–30 days hot, archive cold
- bars: long retention
- execution audit: indefinite or regulated retention
- prompts/tool inputs: redact as needed for privacy

***

## 16) Observability blueprint

### Metrics
- terminal connectivity state
- bridge latency p50/p95/p99
- tool call counts by class
- order submit success rate
- broker reject rate
- slippage distribution
- stale resource count

- adapter failover count

### Logs
Structured logs with:
- `trace_id`
- `intent_id`
- `tool_name`
- `symbol`
- `account_id`
- `adapter`
- `retcode`
- `policy_version`

### Dashboards
- Terminal health
- Account/risk state
- Open exposure

- Incident panel

***

## 17) Deployment topology

### Option 1 — Most robust

#### Arch Linux host
- `mcp-server`
- `policy-service`
- `analytics-service`
- `bridge-gateway`
- `postgres`
- `redis`
- `prometheus`
- `grafana`

#### Windows VM / VPS

- `mt5-policy.service`
- `mt5-analytics.service`
- `mt5-bridge-gateway.service`
- `mt5-worker-supervisor.service`
- `mt5-approval-console.service`

Suggested Windows worker services/tasks:
- `MT5 Terminal`
- `mt5-execution-worker`
- `BridgeConnectorEA` attached to a dedicated chart/profile

***

## 19) MCP tool design details

### Example: `submit_market_order`

#### Input schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "account_id": {"type": "string"},
    "symbol": {"type": "string"},
    "side": {"type": "string", "enum": ["buy", "sell"]},
    "volume_lots": {"type": "number", "exclusiveMinimum": 0},
    "sl": {"type": ["number", "null"]},
    "tp": {"type": ["number", "null"]},
    "deviation_points": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0},
    "strategy_id": {"type": "string"},
    "rationale": {"type": "string"},
    "risk_tag": {"type": "string"},
    "approval_token": {"type": ["string", "null"]}
  },
  "required": [
    "account_id", "symbol", "side", "volume_lots", "strategy_id", "rationale"
  ]
}
```

#### Validation stages
1. schema validation
2. symbol normalization
3. account routing validation
4. environment check
5. risk/policy checks
6. quote freshness check
7. approval check
8. terminal health check
9. broker precheck (`order_check` where available)
10. submit and persist

***

## 20) Approval console

Provide a small internal web UI for approvals.

Features:
- queue of pending trade intents
- plan diff view
- risk summary
- expected margin and exposure impact
- approve / reject with reason
- emergency write-block toggle
- adapter health panel

This gives governance without polluting the AI channel.

***

## 21) Testing strategy

### Test layers

#### Contract tests
- MCP resource/tool schemas stable
- adapter contract compliance

#### Integration tests
- terminal login
- read resource retrieval
- order simulation
- live demo order submit/close on demo account

#### Soak tests
- 24h, 72h, 7-day terminal connectivity
- resource freshness under reconnect events
- adapter failover behavior

#### Chaos tests
- kill terminal during order flow
- disconnect network to broker
- corrupt symbol visibility
- duplicate tool calls
- stale approval token

### Acceptance gates before live trading

1. 7-day soak without critical execution drift
2. zero duplicate live submissions in replay suite
3. policy coverage on all Class 2 tools
4. approval workflow validated end-to-end
5. complete audit trace for every test execution

***

***

## 24) Non-functional requirements

- Read resource p95 latency: < 500 ms local cache, < 1500 ms terminal-backed
- Execution submission p95: < 2000 ms excluding broker fill latency
- Audit completeness: 100% of Class 2/3 actions
- Time sync drift: < 100 ms via NTP/chrony
- Availability target for read plane: 99.5%
- Availability target for write plane in R&D: best effort, guarded by fail-closed policy

***

## 25) Key architectural decisions

### ADR-001: MCP is the only AI-facing interface
Reason: isolates agent changes from execution internals.

### ADR-002: Execution adapter abstraction is mandatory
Reason: Arch Linux + MT5 runtime uncertainty demands pluggable terminal connectivity.

### ADR-003: Policy fail-closed on all sensitive actions
Reason: avoids unsafe model-originated execution.

### ADR-004: Approval console out-of-band from MCP
Reason: separates governance from model reasoning channel.

### ADR-005: Canonical normalized models, raw payload preserved
Reason: stable API for AI while retaining forensic detail.

***

## 26) Immediate implementation recommendation

For your environment, the best deployable starting point is:

1. **Arch Linux** hosts the MCP server, policy engine, analytics, Postgres, Redis, Grafana, and approval console.
2. Start with **`PyMT5Adapter`** if your terminal-side validation succeeds.
3. In parallel, build **`EASocketAdapter`** as the long-term resilience path.
4. Run live execution only after the dual-adapter contract and approval flow are validated.

This gives the R&D team a short path to working software and a longer path to operational robustness.

***
