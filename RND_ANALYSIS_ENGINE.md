# R&D Recommendation: Analysis Engine Enhancements

**Source:** Legacy Chinese Quant System Audit → MT5-MCP Integration Opportunities  
**Date:** April 9, 2026  
**Status:** Recommendations for review

---

## Executive Summary

A full audit of the legacy Chinese quant system (`~/.agents/skills/trading-quant/`, 1011-line CLI with 25 tools across scoring, sentiment, capital flow, and market analysis) reveals **5 high-value features** worth porting to MT5-MCP and **12 features already surpassed** by the current MT5-MCP implementation.

**Bottom line:** MT5-MCP is the more capable system overall. The legacy system contributes specific analytical patterns — not architecture, not infrastructure, not execution logic — but **detection algorithms** that operate purely on OHLCV data and require zero MQL5 EA changes.

**Estimated effort:** ~800 lines of Python across 3 new services + 3 new MCP endpoints.

## 1. What to Port (Ranked by ROI)

### Tier 1: P0 — High Value, Low Effort

#### 1.1 Divergence Detection Engine

**What it does:** Detects when price makes new highs/lows but momentum indicators (MACD, RSI) do not confirm — a high win-rate reversal signal.

| Signal | Logic | Score Impact |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| MACD-Price Bullish Divergence | 10-bar window: price makes new low, MACD does not | +5 |
| MACD-Price Bearish Divergence | 10-bar window: price makes new high, MACD does not | -5 |
| RSI-Price Bullish Divergence | Same logic on RSI(14) | +4 |
| RSI-Price Bearish Divergence | Same logic on RSI(14) | -4 |

**Why it matters:** MT5-MCP has zero divergence detection. This is a pure pandas operation on `get_bars()` + `get_indicator()` output. No EA changes needed.

**Portability:** **As-is.** Indicator-agnostic math.

**Where it goes:** `src/mt5_mcp/services/divergence.py` → new endpoint `POST /tools/analysis/divergence`

**Lines of code:** ~120

---

#### 1.2 Multi-Bar Pattern Recognition

**What it does:** Detects structural chart patterns that span multiple bars — beyond MT5-MCP's existing 5 single-bar candlestick patterns.

| Pattern | Detection Logic | Score Impact |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| W-Bottom | Double bottom within 3% tolerance, neckline break confirmed | +5 (confirmed) / +2 (forming) |
| M-Top | Double top within 3% tolerance, neckline break confirmed | -5 (confirmed) / -2 (forming) |
| Bollinger Squeeze | Bandwidth < 50% of 20-bar average = impending volatility expansion | +3 |
| Breakout Detection | 20-bar high/low breach with volume confirmation | ±3 |
| Gap Detection | >1% gap up/down between consecutive bars | ±2 |
| Fibonacci Retracement | 0.618 retracement + RSI < 45 = high win-rate support zone | +6 |
| Fibonacci Extension | 1.618 extension as profit target | +3 (if reached) / +4 (if holding) |

**Why it matters:** MT5-MCP's `chart_intelligence.py` only detects: doji, hammer, shooting_star, engulfing, inside_bar. These multi-bar patterns capture swing structures that single-bar patterns miss entirely.

**Portability:** **As-is.** Pure OHLCV math. Fibonacci uses swing high/low points from existing `support_resistance()` data.

**Where it goes:** Extend `src/mt5_mcp/services/chart_intelligence.py` with `detect_patterns()` method → exposed via existing `POST /tools/market/chart_intelligence`

**Lines of code:** ~200

---

#### 1.3 Momentum Anti-Chase System

**What it does:** Penalizes entries at extreme moves to prevent buying tops and selling bottoms — behavioral risk management baked into the scoring system.

| Condition | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Price up ≥ 9.5% (limit-up equivalent) | -12 points |
| Price up ≥ 7% | -6 points |
| Price up ≥ 5% | -3 points |
| Price down ≤ -9.5% (limit-down equivalent) | +8 points (contrarian bounce probability) |
| Price down ≤ -7% | +4 points |
| RSI > 80 + STRONG_BUY signal | Downgrade to WATCH |
| RSI < 20 + STRONG_SELL signal | Upgrade to WATCH |

**Why it matters:** MT5-MCP's `opportunity_rank.py` scores opportunity quality but does not penalize chasing. This is a simple post-score adjustment that prevents the AI agent from entering at exhaustion points.

**Portability:** **Needs adaptation.** The ±9.5% thresholds are A-share-specific (price limit mechanism). For MT5 forex/CFD, replace with:
- ATR-based thresholds: price move > 2× ATR(14) from session open = chase risk
- Percentile-based: current bar range > 95th percentile of last 50 bars = exhaustion

**Where it goes:** Add `momentum_penalty` factor to `src/mt5_mcp/services/opportunity_rank.py` OR new `src/mt5_mcp/services/momentum.py` → integrate into `trading/coach` scoring

**Lines of code:** ~80

---

### Tier 2: P1 — High Value, Moderate Effort

#### 1.4 Volume Anomaly Scoring

**What it does:** Multi-tier volume analysis that detects unusual activity beyond simple volume ratios.

| Metric | A-Share Threshold | MT5-Adapted Threshold | Score Impact |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Volume Ratio > 5× | +8 | > 3× avg | +6 |
| Volume Ratio > 3× | +5 | > 2× avg | +4 |
| Volume Ratio > 1.5× | +2 | > 1.3× avg | +2 |
| Volume Ratio < 0.5× | -3 | < 0.5× avg | -3 |
| Amount > 3× 5-day avg | +5 | Volume > 3× 20-bar avg | +4 |
| Price +2% but vol < 0.8× | -4 | Price up but vol declining | -3 (weakness) |
| Price -2% and vol > 3× | -3 | Price down + vol surge | -4 (distribution) |
| Volume + big move correction | -3 to -5 | Same concept | Chase risk penalty |

**Why it matters:** MT5-MCP has `volatility_profile` (ATR-based) but nothing on volume anomalies. Volume confirms or invalidates price moves — a critical missing dimension.

**Portability:** **Needs adaptation.** A-share volume is tick volume (trade count), same as MT5. Only the threshold tiers need recalibration per symbol.

**Where it goes:** `src/mt5_mcp/services/volume_analysis.py` → new endpoint `POST /tools/analysis/volume_profile`

**Lines of code:** ~150

---

#### 1.5 Sector-Aware PE Valuation

**What it does:** PE bands vary by sector — a PE of 30 is cheap for tech but expensive for banks. The legacy system has 16 industry profiles with undervalued/fair/high/extreme thresholds.

| Sector | Undervalued | Fair | High | Extreme |
|--------|------------|------|------|---------|
| Banks | PE < 5 | 5-8 | 8-12 | > 12 |
| Tech | PE < 15 | 15-35 | 35-60 | > 60 |
| Consumer | PE < 15 | 15-25 | 25-40 | > 40 |
| Energy | PE < 6 | 6-12 | 12-18 | > 18 |

**Why it matters:** MT5-MCP has zero fundamental analysis. For CFD/forex, this maps to:
- **Forex pairs:** Real interest rate differentials (carry trade valuation)
- **Indices:** Aggregate sector PE from constituent data
- **Commodities:** Forward curve positioning (contango/backwardation as valuation signal)

**Portability:** **Needs significant adaptation.** The scoring logic is universal; the data sources and industry classifications are entirely China-specific.

**Where it goes:** `src/mt5_mcp/services/valuation.py` → new endpoint `POST /tools/analysis/valuation`

**Lines of code:** ~200 (plus data source integration)

---

### Tier 3: P2 — Investigate, Don't Commit

| Feature | Value | Effort | Verdict |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Gold-silver ratio analysis (60-80 bands) | Moderate — universal for commodity pairs | Low | **Worth porting** if you trade XAU/XAG pair |
| FinBERT sentiment pipeline | Moderate — MT5-MCP already has keyword-based sentiment in `news_service.py` | Medium (swap CN model → ProsusAI/finbert) | **Skip** unless you want deep NLP sentiment |
| Dragon-Tiger list equivalent | Low for forex, high for equities | High (needs SEC Form 4 / 13F / dark pool data) | **Skip** for current MT5 scope |
| Northbound flow equivalent | Moderate — maps to ETF flow / institutional positioning | Medium (needs external data) | **Defer** to Phase 3+ when multi-asset |

---

## 2. What NOT to Port

| Legacy Feature | Why Skip | MT5-MCP Already Has |
|---|---|---|
| Limit up/down pool scanning | China-specific ±10%/±20% price limits. No equivalent in forex/CFD. | `market/regime` (compressing regime captures squeeze) |
| Fried plate pool (failed limit-up) | Only exists in price-limited markets | — |
| Northbound flow via HK Stock Connect | Specific mechanism, not transferable | `economic_calendar` + `news_fetch` |
| Chinese FinBERT (ProsusAI/Chinese) | Wrong language | `news_service.py` keyword-based sentiment |
| Fallback chain + circuit breaker | Generic reliability pattern | TCP → HTTP bridge failover |
| SQLite kline cache | Generic caching | `services/data_store.py` |
| AKShare data source | China-only library | — |
| EastMoney news aggregation | China-only sources | `news_service.py` (16 sources, 5 pools) |
| THS market scanner | China-only API | — |
| CapitalFlowManager 6-level cascade | All data sources are CN-specific | — |

---

## 3. Architecture Impact Assessment

### Zero EA Changes Required

All Tier 1 and Tier 2 features are **pure-Python analysis** operating on data already available via MT5-MCP tools:

| Feature | Input Data Source | Existing MT5-MCP Tool |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Divergence | Bars + MACD/RSI indicators | `get_bars()` + `get_indicator()` |
| Pattern Recognition | Bars (OHLCV) | `get_bars()` |
| Momentum Anti-Chase | Price change, RSI | `get_bars()` + `get_indicator(rsi)` |
| Volume Anomaly | Volume from bars | `get_bars()` |
| Valuation | External data (PE, rates) | Not currently available |

### New Endpoints Required

| Endpoint | Request | Response | Estimated Effort |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `POST /tools/analysis/divergence` | `{symbol, timeframe, indicators=["macd","rsi"], lookback}` | `{bullish: [...], bearish: [...], signals: [...]}` | 2 hours |
| `POST /tools/analysis/volume_profile` | `{symbol, timeframe, lookback}` | `{volume_ratio, volume_tier, anomalies: [...], score}` | 3 hours |
| Extend `POST /tools/market/chart_intelligence` | No schema change | Add `patterns: {w_bottom, m_top, squeeze, breakout, gap, fibonacci}` | 4 hours |
| Modify `POST /tools/trading/coach` | No schema change | Add `momentum_penalty` to advisory section | 1 hour |

**Total estimated effort:** ~10 hours of Python development.

## 5. Alignment with Existing Roadmap

### ROADMAP.md Compatibility

| Existing Roadmap Item | Enhancement Contribution |
|---|---|
| Phase 1.5: Regime detection module | Divergence + patterns enrich regime classification (divergence = regime transition signal) |
| Phase 1.7: Walk-forward validation | Volume anomaly scoring provides additional filter for entry quality |
| Phase 4.1: Regime-adaptive parameters | Momentum anti-chase is inherently regime-adaptive (penalties scale with volatility) |
| ROADMAP codex_aureus finding: "high-vol regime WR = 65.7%" | Volume anomaly scoring directly measures high-vol regime entry quality |

### No Conflicts

None of the proposed features conflict with the ROADMAP's core thesis:
- ✅ No ML price prediction (pure technical analysis)
- ✅ No ML reward optimization (rule-based scoring)
- ✅ No backtesting engine duplication (enhances existing tools)
- ✅ No complex execution framework (pure analysis services)

## 6. Success Metrics

| Feature | Success Criteria | Measurement |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Divergence Detection | > 55% win rate on divergent entries vs 50% baseline | Journal analysis: filter trades taken at divergence signals |
| Pattern Recognition | Patterns detected match visual inspection > 80% of the time | Manual review of 50 chart screenshots vs pattern detection output |
| Volume Anomaly Scoring | Volume-confirmed entries have 10% higher profit factor | Compare PF of trades with volume_score > 70 vs volume_score < 50 |
| Momentum Anti-Chase | Reduces max drawdown by 15% on chase-heavy strategies | Backtest with vs without momentum penalty |

| Dragon-Tiger Equivalent | **NO** | — | Very High | Wrong market structure |
| China-Specific Tools | **NO** | — | N/A | Non-portable |

---

## 8. Recommendation

**Start with Phase A (Divergence + Patterns).** These two features:
1. Require zero EA changes
2. Use data already available from existing MT5-MCP tools
3. Add genuinely new analytical capability (not present anywhere in current codebase)
4. Can be validated by comparing detected signals against visual chart inspection
5. Total ~320 lines of Python, completable in one focused session

**Skip the infrastructure.** The legacy system's fallback chains, caching layers, and data source managers are all superseded by MT5-MCP's TCP bridge, data_store.py, and adapter architecture.

**Treat the scoring system as inspiration, not a blueprint.** The legacy 5-dimension weighted scoring (25/30/10/20/15) is a good framework, but MT5-MCP's 7-factor `opportunity_rank` with regime-aware skip conditions is more sophisticated. Port the *individual analytical components* (divergence, patterns, volume) into the existing `opportunity_rank` framework rather than building a parallel scoring engine.
